# Saureus_6850_methylation

All scripts relevent to the project for course BIO253, funded by micro_innovation grant from UZH.



# Working Plan



# Brainstorming 16/01/2025
* For methylations in the coding regions, what codon (position and AA) are affected?
* Add proteomics data (contrast, log2FC, T, FDR) to mtx data frame (all combinations of contrasts?)
** What contrasts shall be calculated? (all clones vs ancestor? irrespective of growing condition?)


## Questions to potentially adress
* Intergene distances?
* Methylation in gene bodies or in intergenic regions?
* Methylation in promoter regions?
* For methylations in the coding regions, what codon (position and AA) are affected?
